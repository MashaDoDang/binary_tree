# Binary Tree Application

This project is a C++ application for managing and visualizing binary trees, created using the Qt framework. It includes various functionalities for binary search trees, such as insertion, deletion, balancing, and traversal operations. This project was developed as a final project at the end of my first year in university in June 2023.

## Features

- **Binary Search Tree Operations**: Insert, delete, and search for elements in a binary search tree.
- **Tree Balancing**: Balance the binary tree to ensure optimal search times.
- **Tree Traversal**: Perform pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.
- **Tree Visualization**: Visual representation of the tree structure.
- **File Operations**: Save and load tree structures from files.
- **User Interface**: Easy-to-use graphical interface for interacting with the tree.
